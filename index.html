    <div class="top-left-corner">I don't have much to say other than I'm not going to be very active on the internet anymore. All projects that are active are not going to be supported anymore. I have no use for most platforms anymore. If you still want to contact me, you can contact me on this telegram: https://t.me/supplyybin if I don't know you well enough, don't bother messaging me.
        No, I'm not suicidal. No, I'm not going to kill myself. I simply do not enjoy being around the internet anymore and will most likely not come back. I've had good and bad<br> times on the internet. I just don't want to be around all of you because I dislike most of you.<br><br><br><br><br>~ supplybin</div>
